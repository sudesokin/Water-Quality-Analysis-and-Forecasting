## About the Dataset

The dataset comprises several parameters vital for assessing water's quality and safety for consumption:

- **pH Value**: Indicator of water's acid-base balance, within WHO recommended range of 6.5 to 8.5.
- **Hardness**: Measurement of calcium and magnesium salts, which determine water's ability to precipitate soap.
- **Solids (TDS)**: Reflects water's mineralization with a desirable limit set at 500 mg/L for drinking water.
- **Chloramines**: Disinfectants used in water, safe up to 4 mg/L.
- **Sulfate**: Naturally occurring substances with concentrations in freshwater typically ranging from 3 to 30 mg/L.
- **Conductivity**: Indicator of water's ionic concentration with a standard limit not exceeding 400 Î¼S/cm as per WHO.
- **Organic Carbon**: Measures carbon in organic compounds in water, with EPA standards set for treated and source water.
- **Trihalomethanes (THMs)**: By-products of chlorine treatment, safe up to 80 ppm.
- **Turbidity**: Measure of water's clarity, with WHO standards recommending values below 5.00 NTU.
- **Potability**: Binary indicator of whether water is safe (1) or not (0) for consumption.

## Scope of the Project

The project entails a comprehensive approach to predict future water quality levels accurately, covering:
